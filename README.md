# UR5 BIO VISION 
## Introduction 
This project was created by an intern at Universit√© de Sherbrooke. It provides vision to a UR5 collaborative robot. The robot conducts biological experiences and interact with his environnement the same way a human does, to simplify the gradual automatisation of the university's manipulations. It uses a Intel realsense 415 camera (https://store.intelrealsense.com/buy-intel-realsense-depth-camera-d415.html) to catpure images. With a visual component inside the arm, it can now accomplish three mandates. The first one is to measure the agar, on wich liquid is poured to visualize growth of bacteries. The second one is to confirm the state of the thermo-cycler that the robot interacts with. The last one is to confirm that the robot has written the right volume on the thermo-cycler's keyboard. 

## First Mandate : measure the Agar
